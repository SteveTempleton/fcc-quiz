      <p>Computers make excellent and efficient servants, but I have no wish to serve under them. ... the prejudices
        people feel about each other disappear when they get to know each other. Insufficient facts always invite
        danger. Madness has no purpose. Or reason. But it may have a goal. Genius doesn't work on an assembly line
        basis. Did Einstein, Kazanga or Sitar of Vulcan produce new and revolutionary theories on a regular schedule?

        obtain that which you do not want. Resistance Is Futile! Do you know the old Klingon proverb that revenge is a
        dish best served cold? It is very cold — in space. No, Kirk, no. You’ll not escape. From hell’s heart, I stab
        at thee. …For spite’s sake, I spit my last breath at thee. I’ve done far worse than kill you. …I’ve hurt you;
        and I intend to go on… hurting you. I will leave you as you left me; as you left her. Marooned for all
        eternity at the center of a dead planet. …Buried alive; buried alive….</p>

      <h2>Insufficient facts always invite danger. They used to say that if Man was meant to fly, he'd have wings. But
        he did fly. He discovered he had to. Beam Me Up, Scotty! …Warp speed.</h2>
      <p>Logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end. Computers make excellent and efficient servants, but I have no
        wish to serve under them. Insufficient facts always invite danger. To be human is to be complex. You can't
        avoid
        a little ugliness -- from within -- and from without. You know the greatest danger facing us is ourselves, and
        irrational fear of the unknown. There is no such thing as the unknown. Only things temporarily hidden,
        temporarily not understood.</p>
      <p>A man either lives life as it happens to him, meets it head-on and licks it, or he turns his back on it and
        starts to wither away. When a child is taught, it's programmed with simple instructions, and at some point, if
        its mind develops properly, it exceeds the sum of what it was taught, thinks independently. Genius doesn't

      <p>Curious, how often you humans manage to obtain that which you do not want. Now, I don't pretend to tell you

        because the days and the years ahead are worth living for! Khaaannnn! Do you know the old Klingon proverb that
